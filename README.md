# Dark Eight Theme

I finally found a theme that I liked but it wasn't DARK enough. So, here I present Dark Eight.

Some aspects of it are a bit messy internally. But, it works perfectly as far as I can tell.

At some point in time I may clean up the theme internals.. or feel free to contribute.

The syntax highlighting theme is Pastel Paws. [Available Here](https://github.com/Ociidii-Works/Pastel-Paws.tmTheme)
