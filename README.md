# Dark Eight Theme

I finally found a theme that I liked but it wasn't DARK enough. So, here I present Dark Eight.

Some aspects of it are a bit messy internally. But, it works perfectly as far as I can tell.

At some point in time I may clean up the theme internals.. or feel free to contribute.

# Installation

Launch Sublime Text then choose the menu bar options PREFERENCES then BROWSE PACKAGES.

Clone this repo into Packages/Theme - Dark Eight

Then, just add this line to your user settings file PREFERENCES -> SETTINGS - USER:

    "theme": "Eight.sublime-theme",

## License

Based on the Eight theme by Andreas Westerlind which in turn was based on the Phoenix theme, which is in turn is based on the Soda Theme by Ian Hill (http://buymeasoda.com/)
